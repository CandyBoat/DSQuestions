## 1. (Given a Dataset) Analyze this dataset and give me a model that can predict this response variable.

..* Check the size of the data, type of the response variable and distribution of reposonse variable, then have a rouge range of model that I can choose.

..* Ask for purpose of the model, easy to interpret or better accuracy, then make choice between a model easy to inteprete (like GLM, decision tree) or model without parameters (like machine learning models gbm, xgboost, neural network).

..* Ask for data definition, including all potential predictive variables, correlated variables, data collection issue if any (manually input or machine recorded).

..* Start EDA, visulize the data, can try univariate type plots, bi-variate plot, check potential correlation, outliers, missing value.
